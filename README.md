### #100DaysofML

# 100 Days of Machine Learning Challenge

Welcome! It all began with the idea to challenge myself and accelerate my career in machine learning by embarking on a #100DaysOfCode journey, tailored specifically for AI, ML, DL, and Python engineering.

With the help of ChatGPT-4, I crafted a 100-day plan that would take me from beginner to advanced level, creating real-world projects each day.

ChatGPT helped me to design a spreadsheet spanning 100 days, meticulously organizing each dayâ€™s Challenge Title, Challenge Description, Anki Interview Q/A, and progress tracking across several areas, including GitHub, Twitter, networking, CodeWars, and blog publishing. 

With the roadmap laid out, my 100 Days of ML odyssey have commenced, fueled by dedication, curiosity, and the desire to learn and grow. It will be updated each day, once I complete a project.
